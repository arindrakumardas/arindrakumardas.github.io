          <p class="lead" style="font-size:14px;">Biometrics is a deeply studied and highly developed technology. While biometric systems have been used primarily in limited applications requiring high security tasks like criminal identification and police work, more recently they have been receiving increasing demand for person recognition applications. This project presents a novel intelligent approach analyzing the existence of any relationship among fingerprints and face parts.

          <p class="lead" style="font-size:14px;">With ageing, there are many long-term conditions (LTC) such as dementia, chronic pain and frailty. The elderly person with LTC needs support to carry out their daily activities. Usually family, friend or relative, often referred to as the informal carer, take care of the elderly person. Caring induces emotional turmoil and physical burden bringing adverse effect on the health of these informal carers. Furthermore, there is limited research on the well being of informal carers of elderly people. The aim of the study is to gain insights about the caring process of informal carers for the elderly person; the barriers they face; the strategies they use to overcome them; and the technologies they use. In addition, investigate on supporting them with the use of technology.
